These are my notes on some lectures in the winter term 2019/20 at the University Bonn. I mostly write them because it helps me concentrate on the lecture. Hence I will not invest much time to make them look good afterwards. Nevertheless comments and corrections are welcome and can be made through the issues feature of github.

The built pdfs can be found on https://nicholas-schwab.de/ws1920/

For Global Analysis I please also look at the (probably much better) notes by Jendrik: https://gitlab.com/lecture-notes-bonn/global-analysis-1-notes-ws-19-20
